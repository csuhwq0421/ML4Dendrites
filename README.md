# ML4Dendritic
## This is the official repository for the paper ‘Machine intelligence-guided growth and multifactorial mechanism deciphering of two-dimensional ReSe2 dendrites’.
### Short cuts
- The Bayesian optimization folder holds the code and data for quickly optimizing the CVD parameters for the high fractal dimension of the 2D ReSe2.
* The data expansion folder holds the code and data for filtering the largest dataset by MAE on the Bayesian dataset.
+ The ExplainableML process folder holds the code and data for interpreting XGBoost models via SHAP methods.
